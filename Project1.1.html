    <p class="p3">During the summer of 2023, I embarked on a small business journey using Amazon Fba. In this period of time 
        I acquired skills such as inventory management, business planning, and financial oversight. Although this endeavor ultimately came to an end, 
        I gained valuable insight in the business realm which I will definitely utilize on my next attempt.</p>

    <p class="p4">Embarking on a new journey is always dauting. I recently started learning how to code as an Intern at Road 2 Hire.
        At first It seemed a bit dificult, but as I learn more, the topic became less worrying.</p>
